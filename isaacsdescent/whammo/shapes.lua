    Here's the fun part!

    We have two line segments, A and B.  Segment A is moving along the movement
    vector v.  When, and where, will it strike segment B -- if at all?

                  B
                  |
       A     v    |
        \   /     |
         \        |
          \
           \

    It's easier to reason about if A, B, and v are all orthogonal.

                  B
                  |
        A         |
        |  --> v  |
        |         |
        |

    Now the solution isn't too hard (which is probably why everyone uses only
    AABBs).  If A and B overlap horizontally, and the horizontal distance
    between them is less than v, then A will collide with B.  Done.

    Observe that in the above diagram, if we tilt A or B slightly, there are
    only four possible points of contact: the endpoints of A and B.  This is
    true in general: the endpoints are "corners", and two objects can only
    collide at corners or along edges.  So either one of those points is the
    collision point, the two lines are parallel and come to touch each other
    (in which case at least two of the endpoints will still collide anyway), or
    the lines won't meet at all.

    The trick to the general case, then, is to do the same thing -- but instead
    of looking along the x-axis, we have to look along the v-axis.  (You could
    do this by literally rotating the plane, but that would take a bunch of
    trig, which is slow and not actually necessary.)  First we express the two
    line segments as pairs of parametric equations, which you may recall are
    equations that define x and y separately in terms of another variable t.

        x = x0 + t * (x1 - x0)
        y = y0 + t * (y1 - y0)

    This makes t range from 0 to 1 along each segment, which is handy, because
    it's very easy to tell whether a given t lies within the segment.

    Next, we consider one of B's endpoints, P.  P can be expressed -- uniquely!
    -- as a point Q somewhere on A, shifted along v by some distance dv.  This
    is just like the orthogonal case, only following the v vector instead of
    the x-axis.  The result looks like:

        P = Q + dv * v

    But P and Q are both points, v is a vector, and Q (being on A) is defined
    by parametric equations.  We can split this up and substitute those in:

        Px = Ax0 + t * (Ax1 - Ax0) + dv * v
        Py = Ay0 + t * (Ay1 - Ay0) + dv * v

    All of these values are known, except t and dv.  This is a simple system of
    linear equations; solve it, and you know how far along the movement the
    collision happens (dv).  Repeat for all four points, constrain to the line
    segments, and we have the answer.

    In fact, we don't even need to try all four points, because we already the
    answers for A's endpoints: they're A's endpoints, plus zero of v!  So we
    can just try B's endpoints.
