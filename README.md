# Isaac's Descent HD Remix

This is a puzzle-platformer based on the PICO-8 game I did for Ludum Dare 36, [Isaac's Descent](https://c.eev.ee/isaacs-descent/).

It requires [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 0.10+ and nothing else.


## Running

Just install LÖVE and run this repository with it.

    git clone https://github.com/eevee/isaacs-descent.git
    love isaacs-descent


## Built with

- [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)

- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

- A little inspiration from the [PICO-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/)
